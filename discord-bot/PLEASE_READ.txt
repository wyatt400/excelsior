PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING!
You may delete this file after you're done, but we reccomend that you don't for future reference.

This is the complete source code for the project.
The .py files are the Python files. They are the "code" of the bot.
The rest of the files, excluding this file, are the packager files. They "package" the bot and make it work.

Please use a python server that has enough RAM, can connect to Discord.py, and is pingable by Uptime Robot on a Flask webserver.
If you need any help, I'll be happy to help, but because you guys aren't hosted with us anymore, we unfortunately can't provide that much technical support.

When you are done uploading, you need to add an environmental variable with a name of "newkey" and a value that we will send to you. We cannot put the value here as this source
code is public and that value is basically the "password" to the Discord bot. It will NOT work without the "password."
